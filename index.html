    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Hened Medina, but I usually go by my nickname Ned. I <em>love</em> eating
    ramen and sushi.</p>
    <p>I am <strong>allergic</strong> to peanuts, in which I become itchy and find it difficult 
    to breathe. I am 18 years old and live in British Columbia and I enjoy going on hikes.</p>
